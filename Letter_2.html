      <h1>Dear Love,</h1>
        <p>Today, when I saw you walking toward me, my heart felt lighter, and a big smile appeared on my face. Just seeing you made my entire day. You looked so beautiful in your outfit; it suited you perfectly. When you parked your scooty and our eyes met, and you smiled at me, I swear my mind exploded with happiness.</p>
        <p>Afterward, when we went to the caf√© and sat down, all I wanted was to keep staring at you. I was a little annoyed, though, because you came with wet hair, and I was worried about you catching a cold or falling sick. But as I looked into your beautiful eyes, I felt a sense of calm and joy that nothing else could bring.</p>
        <p>When we ordered coffee, I couldn‚Äôt help but want to capture every little moment of you. I recorded a video of you, not just to make a memory but because I wanted to relive those moments over and over again. As we chatted about random things, I found myself falling even more in love with the way you talk and share every little detail of your day with me. I adore how animated you get, how much you love to speak your heart out‚Äîyour ‚Äúchapar chapar‚Äù brings me endless joy. üòÇ</p>
        <p>Then, somewhere in the middle of our conversation, I mentioned wanting a football. At first, you teased me, saying I loved football more than anything. But eventually, you agreed, and we went to the mall where you bought me the football. I felt like the happiest person alive in that moment, knowing how thoughtful and caring you are.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm so grateful to God for blessing me with the most supportive, beautiful, and intelligent girlfriend‚Äîand future wife. Spending time with you is the highlight of my life.</p>
        <p>Afterward, we visited Mr. DIY, where we laughed and teased each other, creating memories I‚Äôll cherish forever. Your smile and laughter are the most precious things to me. Seeing you happy fills my heart with peace and joy, and I want to make sure you always stay this way‚Äîsmiling, laughing, and feeling loved.</p>
        <p>I love you endlessly, my constant, my everything.</p>
        <p><strong>Your Tanmay</strong></p>
