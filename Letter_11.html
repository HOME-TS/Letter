      <h1>Chicoüíñ</h1>
      <p>Today is holiday so there is no lecture and no college so i was not going to see her today, that make me sad üòîüò¢, she posted so many stories in her insta some stories are in close and some for all to see, i dont why she posted this stories for all to, i dont is she wanna make me bad person for all, i feel really bad and sad bcz she posting for all she posted her self with new look, is she wanted to show all that now is fine n single or she wanted make me feel bad, is she doing on purpose or just bcz i dont know any and i cant ask her, i always told her to not to post stories when we had fights or happen anything between us, maybe now i am no one to tell her to dont post stories, she making me villan in front of everyone and making me bad person, any of the reason im really hurt bcz of this</p>
      <p>i just wanted her to apologies n correct her behaviour, this time i never got angry n never talked her in high pitch voice i was just tryinng to express her that somthings hurting me and in relationship i just wanted her to maanv me , i just want her to show she is sorry for what she did, i think she dont know wht she did, i hope she found out what she did that hurting me, she never asked herself why i am this much hurt, most of the time i leave the topic but i am holding to it why she cant ask herself she did smthing wrong and thats why im behaving like this</p>
      <p>what she did is everyday(means most of the time) showing me n compering me with other guys and characters, by saying "Look this guy how he treat his girlfriend, see they are posting pics, they are doing that, look this guy really cares abt her" maybe she dont how bad n hurting it is to listen to this always compering and wht other do for there girlfriend it feels like im shitty boyfriend n i dont do anything for her, she dont know the impact of this lines, how this line hurt.</p>
      <p>maybe she say this bcz she is happy for them or wanted to show me things but its not always the case, when i see n hear i can sense she wants that type n im not doing any of this stuff she sometimes says you dont do this n that, but it hurts like hell, how someone feel by always comparing to others?? maybe someday she will know that</p>
      <p>i never compared her with anyone or never expected her to do something extra for me i only wanted her, i never even compared or talked about characters in movie or series bcz she the only one i liked so i cant compare her to anyone, i never said her that "look at this girl how cute she is, see what she is doing for her boyfriend" anything like this i never said because ik this will hurt her insted of comparing or showing her from wht others doing i told her directly that dont do this n i want this from you like everyone in relationship should do, they can ask there partners directly</p>
      <p>Anyways i saw her snap she was wearing red saree she wore when we went to iskon in that saree she looked like absolute beauty, aspsara, and angel, why she so cute with that new haircut and that jhumka of hers with bugdi adding more charm in her, she is so cuteeeeeee ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®</p>
