      <p><strong>What is love to me? </strong></p>
      <p>Love means you, everything i learned about love from you, the way you see me with those eyes with full of love, i still remember how you hugged me, that warmth in your arms, how you touched my face with that soft hands, i can feel everything, you did everything for me n i love you.I love you like no one can, i love with my all heart and soul.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>How i will love you?</strong></s></p>
      <p>Love is a deep, selfless connection between souls an emotion that goes beyond words and defies logic. its not just about passion or attraction; its about presence, trust, and care. That is love.

        And with you, I promise this:
        I will make your presence feel seen and valued.
        I will listen truly listen so you always feel heard.
        I will put you first, not just in words, but in action.
        Because you matter. Your presence matters. Your emotions matter.
    </p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>My love for you?</strong></p>
      <p>I love you with all my heart and soul. I have never loved anyone the way I love you its different, deeper, and so real, You truly mean everything to me. I know I am not always the best at expressing how I feel, but please believe this my love for you is constant, honest, and full. Every time I close my eyes, I see you so clearly the same sweet, innocent girl I saw the first time we met. That image, that feeling, it still calms my heart in ways nothing else can. Just thinking of you brings me peace. You’re the one who feels like home to me.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>why i love you?</strong></p>
      <p>i didn't even know, this feelings come from inside not bcz of your look or about behavior, i just love your presence your voice, your eyes. your presence completes me. i dont need any reason to love you, if there is reason to love you that means thats not love that is something else</p>      
      <br>
      <p><strong>What are my intentions of loving you?</strong></p>
      <p>I want you give you that love you never received, i want you give peaceful love, love that you deserve, i want to have happy family with you, you me and one little our girl.</p>
