      <h1>Chicoüíñ</h1>
      <p>Today we had little chat about the situation, and she told me that she dont wanna be with me, she thinks i dont care about her and now everyone thinks that im not good person. her mom and her bff and maybe everyone. i dont care about everyone but her mother now hates me its making me sad and cant do anything about thats the thing making me more sad.</p>
      <p>she thinks i dont care about her, how i can tell her i much i care about her, when something happens to her i was the one hurting my heart starts racing i never wanted to see her suffer anything i want her to be healthy. whenever she was going through i wanted to be with her i wanted to be her strength, i want help her to become healthy n stronger, maybe i failed to show that i care about her, its not her fault my feelings never reached her, i never expressed her that how much i care about her, for rest her life she will think i never really care about her thats the sad stroy abt me, i failed in everything.</p>
      <p>That day i never really did anything on purpose, i was hurt, when she speak about others relationship admire them i feel like i never do anything for us she always says that you dont do this n that when we fight or sometimes, she shows me im boring person saddu person maybe she say was just joking or other reasons, but when she speak about other it feels like she not happy with me n im not enough for her, im not angry because of this but im really hurt when i hear this things she was just admiring them  but to me she just showing me that see how others treat and you dont treat me like this. i dont know im right if its hurting or i should not get hurt from this things. i dont know im right or wrong but im really hurt</p>
      <p>i just wanted her to maanav me just come n say something good to me make feel like im good for her within 0.0000001 sec i will forget everything but it never happened. im not saying she never tried she tried but i want her to mean it whenever she said she sorry she gave me n explaination and she was trying to give her reasons i will listen everything why she did n all but first come to me just console me n then you can speak anythings any explanation i will listen, this only thing i wanted that time.</p>
      <p>Im sorry to her for everything maybe i did something because of that she was hurt, my tone and how i treated her all was wrong. i just wanted her to console me just talk love dobey to me thats the only thing i wanted, because of this thing i did made distance between us. im sorry for treating you bad, im sorry for not being with you, im sorry for not caring about you, now i dont even know this sorry will reach her and this sorry cant make my mistake goes, she will never forgive me n its oky now i did something stupid now this is my punishment.</p>
      <p>Today we met online on discord i saw her n she was reallt looking cuteeee shes been always cute in her daily home wear in her cozy outfits. i wanted to give her kiss i did inside my mind hhehehheehhe, if i did that she will get angry so i kissed her many times in my mind, i kuchupchued her cheeks ‚ù§Ô∏èü§å</p>
      <p>Now only thing i can do is i can love, i can see her, i can admire her from distance</p>
      <p>(im not complaing, explaining or not showing who's right or wrong in this all letters im just writing thoughts inside of my mind)</p>
