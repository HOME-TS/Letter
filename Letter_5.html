      <h1>My Love,</h1>
        <P>As this year comes to an end, I can’t help but reflect on all the moments we’ve shared—the good, the challenging, and everything in between. It’s been a year of learning and growing for both of us, and I know I’ve made mistakes along the way. I’ve hurt you at times, and for that, I’m deeply sorry. I want you to know that I regret every moment I made you feel anything less than cherished. Despite the difficult times, you stood by me with so much patience, love, and strength. For that, I’m forever grateful.</P>
        <p>From the moment I first saw you, I fell in love. And then, I fell in love again—this time with your incredible personality, your kind heart, and the way you love so purely and selflessly. You’re not just amazing; you’re extraordinary. You have this unique ability to bring peace and happiness into my life just by being near. Never doubt yourself, my love. You’re strong, beautiful, and kind, and I’ll always be here to remind you of that whenever you need it.</p>
        <p>Let’s leave all the misunderstandings, arguments, and hurt behind us, where they belong. This new year is a chance for us to start fresh—to forgive, to heal, and to focus on the love we share. I promise to take better care of you, to be more thoughtful with my words, and to never let my anger overshadow the love I have for you. I want us to build something unbreakable—a relationship where we both grow stronger together.</p>
        <p>You mean everything to me, and I want us to dream and build a future together. I see a life where it’s you and me, in our own home, creating memories with our little family. I want to explore the world with you, support your dreams, and build a lifetime of happiness side by side.</p>
        <p>I love you, not just today, not just this year, but forever and in every life to come. You’re my one and only, and I’m so blessed to have you in my life.</p>
        <p>Here’s to us, my love—to a brighter, stronger, and more beautiful future together.</p>
        <p>Forever yours,</p>
        <p><strong>Your Tanmay</strong></p>
